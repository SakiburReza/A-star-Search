The n-puzzle is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer
Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 𝑘 × 𝑘 grid with 𝑛 = 𝑘ଶ − 1 square blocks labeled 1
through 𝑛 and a blank square. My goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order, using
as few moves as possible. The following shows a sequence of legal moves from an initial board (left) to the goal
board (right).
