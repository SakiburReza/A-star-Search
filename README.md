The n-puzzle is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer
Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 𝑘 × 𝑘 grid with 𝑛 = 𝑘ଶ − 1 square blocks labeled 1
through 𝑛 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order, using
as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank
square. The following shows a sequence of legal moves from an initial board (left) to the goal
board (right).  
1 3           1   3           1 2 3         1 2 3             1 2 3
4 2 5    →    4 2 5     →     4   5    →    4 5        →      4 5 6
